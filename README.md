# elm-blackscholes
A basic Black Scholes implementation in Elm, with a dirty Elm calculator UI

The idea is to advance this to show off how to use Elm for real business application,
even though ["Option traders use (very) sophisticated heuristics, never the
Black–Scholes–Merton formula."](http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/MATH3075/r/Haug_Taleb_2011.pdf)

Regardless, we're converting and validating input, running calculations, and binding model data to 
the presentation.
